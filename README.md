# dementianet-whisper-xai
Speech analysis on DementiaNet dataset using Whisper ASR and Explainable AI to study dementia vs. non-dementia recordings.

This project applies OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model to the DementiaNet dataset (speech recordings of people with and without dementia) to generate transcriptions and extract features. Explainable AI methods are used to interpret model predictions and highlight linguistic and acoustic markers of dementia.
